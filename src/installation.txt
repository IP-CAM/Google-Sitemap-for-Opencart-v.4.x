Playful Sparkle - Google Sitemap

The Playful Sparkle - Google Sitemap extension for OpenCart 4.x+ offers a
refined XML sitemap generation solution that aligns with search engine standards
and SEO best practices. This extension supports detailed customization, allowing
OpenCart merchants to tailor sitemaps to include specific product pages
(with images), category pages (with images), and manufacturer pages, all tagged
to support complete, accurate indexing by search engines.

A key feature of the extension is its use of PHP’s XMLWriter class to generate
standards-compliant XML sitemaps per the https://sitemaps.org/protocol.html.
This ensures that search engines can efficiently crawl site content, aided by
the <lastmod> attribute included on product and category pages. The <lastmod>
attribute, which tracks the date of the most recent content update, allows
search engines to prioritize updated pages, increasing the likelihood of
timely indexing.

To streamline sitemap accessibility, the extension can automatically update the
.htaccess file, enabling users and Google Search Console to access sitemaps
using clean, SEO-friendly URLs like /en-gb/sitemap.xml instead of the default
OpenCart URL format, such as
index.php?route=extension/feed/ps_google_sitemap&language=en-gb.
This improvement ensures compatibility with Google Search Console requirements
and simplifies sitemap management.

Additionally, the extension validates the robots.txt file to verify whether the
sitemap is allowed by Google. This proactive check notifies you early if
adjustments to the file are needed, ensuring your sitemap is discoverable and
functional for search engine indexing.

With multi-store and multi-language support, the extension allows merchants to
create separate sitemaps for different store views and languages. This enables
each store or language version of your site to have its own tailored sitemap,
ensuring better indexing and visibility in search engines for audiences in
different regions and languages.
